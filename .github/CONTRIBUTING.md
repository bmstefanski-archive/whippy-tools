First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute :)

## Coding conventions
- we indent using 2 spaces - in yaml, json, etc. files;
- we are using [Google's Java code style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html);
- all things should be in english (except for issue);
- keep it nice and clean.

That's all, happy contributing!
